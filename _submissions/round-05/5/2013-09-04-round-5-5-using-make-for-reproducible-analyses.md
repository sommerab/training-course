I just realized I hadn't written up my blog post for the final assignment...whoops!

All the material I've created for the assignment I've put in a git repository available at [https://github.com/fishjord/make\_swc\_quickstart][1]

For this final assignment I chose to do a quick introduction to GNU Make, and outlined why I find it useful for constructing analysis pipelines.  For a 10 minute talk it was a bit ambitious.  I ended up drastically toning down what I covered, toning back from a real working example from my own day-to-day research to a more toy-ish but easier to follow example.

I think that actually worked out fairly well in the end, the group I presented to (a few co-workers, one of whom I'm trying desperately to get to use something to document analysis pipelines) were computer savvy, but how make works is difficult to get started with.
