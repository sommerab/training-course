This was an excellent course, and very enjoyable.  I liked the format of
meetings every two weeks with homework in between.  It gave me time to digest
things.  I have a young daughter, and I have really enjoyed learning so much
about teaching for the sake of helping her learn.  Even if I never teach with
SWC, this has been very worthwhile.

I did not like how haphazard participation in group activities was.  The review
part of activities, such as commenting on other people's posts, seemed like they
were frequently ignored.  I know that this is simply par for the course for a
volunteer course like this and that people get out what they put in, but it was
frustrating.  At the same time, I believe it would be too much work and
micromanagement to make this otherwise.

Though I did not struggle with git or markdown, having had some previous
experience, I do think a mini how-to tutorial would be helpful for people.  I
did not feel comfortable pointing out good GitHub etiquette and such - it really
wasn't the place to be nitpicking, but SWC and this course are great, warm
places to learn those lessons.  I wonder if Greg might enlist some help for
future courses in merging participant PRs - people who can volunteer themselves
to both make suggestions and guide people in making corrections.
