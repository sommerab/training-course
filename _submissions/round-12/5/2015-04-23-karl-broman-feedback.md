I was familiar with many of the basic concepts that were covered in this
instructor training course, but I'd not put them into
practice in my teaching. Now, however, I can see better how to do it, and
so I think I really _will_ put these ideas into practice.

I found the homework exercises in the course particularly useful. The
most important one for me was that on writing good multiple-choice
questions (MCQs). I think if there's one way that I can improve my
teaching, in classes from small to large (and in guest lectures or
even research seminars, for that matter!), it'll be by spending time
developing MCQs, to both gauge students' understanding and to get them
thinking.

Greg Wilson is an awesome instructor, and just seeing how he does an
over-the-phone (plus [etherpad](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/)) class
was really inspiring. I don't quite know how I could duplicate that,
but the frequent yes/no or very-short-answer questions were obviously
helpful both for gauging students and keeping them engaged.

So this was a really useful course for me. Some of the homeworks were
time-consuming and painful, but they were usefully time-consuming and
painful.

I'm quite convinced by the software carpentry practice of live
coding with no slides, and I hadn't been before.

The one thing that could have been improved for me (a minor quibble):
I would have liked to have had a schedule in advance. I wasn't quite
sure how many sessions I was committing to. That the course ended when
it did was a bit of a surprise.
