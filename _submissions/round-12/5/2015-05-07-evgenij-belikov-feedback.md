I have enjoyed learning many useful things from a great teacher and from other 
participants. Many of the introduced concepts were new to me. In particular,
the suggested reading helped consolidate knowledge acquired during the meetings.

I liked the focus on becoming a better teacher and on various pitfalls that may make 
learning difficult, many of which I found omitted in other teaching workshops. 
In particular, the importance of assessing students' prior knowledge and how well they 
follow along and keeping them engaged shouldn't be underestimated. One good example
was the use of sticky notes at one SWC bootcamp (green - I'm ok, red - I need help).

I believe visualisation (e.g. using Concept Maps) can help explain many of the concepts 
that are on the SWC syllabus. Live Coding is useful as it helps throttle the pace and 
provides examples and opportunities to practice for the participants (and show that 
teachers make mistakes and how they recover).

It was good to see teaching principles supported by reasearch results. To me it was
surprising that high expertise may actually be detrimental in teaching. This insight 
is also good for encouraging more people to help with running workshops who otherwise 
might think they are not enough of an expert.

Another surprise for me was the effectiveness of MCQs. Perhaps previously I only
came across badly-designed MCQs in rote learning context and dismissed them too
quickly as not useful (maybe due to relatively high probability of guessing correct
answers). False answers based on good distractors give valuable hints at problem areas.

This course has also assured me of the value of feedback (both to students and among 
teachers). This would be the only reason why I'd prefer teaching face-to-face.
But overall, I liked the spread-out format as I spent more time in total on thinking
about teaching and doing the homework than I could on a 2-day course.

I think there should be no formal requirements for participation in this course apart
from high motivation to put in the extra hours for homework and commitment to participate
in the online meetings. However, I found it helpful having participated in a bootcamp as 
a learner. I felt familiar with the content (e.g. git) and could focus on the new concepts
and on the delivery of the material. It also made it easier to imagine teaching situations 
and map the concepts discussed to concrete examples and experiences. Technical issues 
(github/markdown) could be reduced by providing more detailed step-by-step instructions 
in advance. Knowing how to handle the tools used by the community is necessary for being 
able to effectively contribute to the development of the materials. It was nice to see
how community members familiar with these tools stepped in to help.

I have enjoyed practicing online with others and I'm looking forward to put the learned 
into practice and help out at a forthcoming bootcamp in my region.
