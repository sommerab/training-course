##A demotivational story

In my first quarter as a PhD student, I took a thoroughly demotivating
course on statistical physics. Our instructor was very intelligent
and well known in his field, but I don't think that he'd ever been
given the instructional support that he needed to develop a mastery of
teaching. He started the first day of class by telling us that he could
not improve upon a classic textbook in the field so we should just read
the book from cover to cover and then we would understand everything.

Having set such low expectations for his added instructional value, he
continued to meet them throughout the quarter. Our lectures never really
correlated with any particular section of the book. He "covered" the
required sections of the book within the first half of the quarter and
then moved on to "more interesting" advanced topics. My classmates and I
struggled to connect his lectures with the required readings and we were
unable to follow along with the more advanced sessions because we hadn't
yet solidified our grasp of the basics.

Most lectures were very poorly executed. The instructor would get lost 
in his own notes. When students asked questions, the instructor would 
usually respond be repeating exactly what he had said before but with 
a louder voice. Finally, students would be admonished to read the 
entire book. It would all become clear if we would just read the 
book.

The homework sets were incredibly time consuming for me, mostly because
I had to spend a lot of time understanding what the question was asking.
Often, the solutions that our instructor would hand out afterward
simply told us to read a certain chapter in the textbook. Likewise, my
study sessions were unproductive because the requirement to "understand
everything" was so vague that I felt overwhelmed by the material and
didn't know where to start.

I passed the class and the qualifying exam in statistical physics. But 
to this day, I know that my understanding of the subject is lacking. 
It's a shame to feel like I am missing out on a beautiful field of 
physics.

##What could have been done to fix this?

My instructor had a very firm grasp of the material. But he either
forgot what it was like to learn that material in the first place or
he was completely self-taught because his expectation for students was
one of instant and unaided expertise. To combat this expectation and
(re)motivate the class he should have done some of the following things:

- Compose a list of topics that students will be expected to know. The
requirements to "understand everything" and the advice to "just read the
entire book" are not constructive. Their vagueness can be overwhelming
and they fail to capitalize upon the expertise of the instructor in
focusing students' attention on the salient aspects of the class.
- Correlate each lecture with a section of the textbook. This could be
as simple as writing down the appropriate chapter or section numbers on
the board before class begins.
- Cover less material, cutting the advanced lectures out entirely, in
order to move at the pace of the class and ensure that students get
the fundamental concepts before moving on.
- Confer with other instructors about course content. For example, ask
them if the problem sets are clear or ask to see or use their previous
problem sets. Ask them for a list of topics that they covered in a
previous section along with a rough schedule of their lectures.
- Provide, or have the teaching assistant provide, more comprehensive
solutions to the homework problems.

##Mea Culpa

I should also point out that as a student, I failed to let the
instructor know what I needed to succeed. At the time, I bought into the
myth that teaching was an inherent gift. I thought that good teachers
were born rather than developed through practice. But it's likely that 
my instructor has never really received honest and constructive feedback
about his teaching. It's both sad and uncomfortable when the job of
providing that feedback falls on the students. And I'm still not sure
how I would have confronted my instructor about his deficits. But I have
to admit that as a silent student, I was complicit in a system that has
failed to develop this professor's pedagogical skills.
