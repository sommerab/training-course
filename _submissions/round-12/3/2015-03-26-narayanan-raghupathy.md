The demotivating example I have is about my math teacher's teaching style
in my high school. It is not just a personal demotivating example, rather 
affecting the whole class and potentially the students' future interests in math.

My high school math teacher's teaching style or lack of any style, is anything 
but inspiring. He will randomly pick a few problems in each class and solve 
it on the black board without really bothering about whether any of the students 
understood or not. He would simply keep writing down steps on the board and 
we will all be frantically copying before erases part of it to write more.
The worst of all is that he will just solve a few problems and call that
the "remaining all problems are homework". This was his way of saying,
I am done with this chapter and it is up to you get the rest of the 
chapter. He was such a nightmare that asking any question during the class 
wasn not an option.

This style had big effect on how I learnt math later in both positive 
and negative ways. On the positive side, it made me a more independent 
learner. On the negative side, since high school was such a crucial
time, to catch up with the class, I started to use solution manuals 
to understand/solve a problem. This habit had big negative effect in college
where I had to solve problems on my own without any solution manuals.

#### What could have been done afteward to fix it?
Later on I learned that he either had a PhD or was doing PhD; was not 
happy teaching high school kids; and was in the job for convenience. 

I am not really sure what I could have done to fix it. May be the school
could have done something.
