##A Demotivating Experience
I remember a demotivating experience during my postgraduate studies. 
Participating in a lecture on 'Distributed Systems Programming' 
I asked some questions that went slightly beyond the scope of the 
curriculum and the lecturer merely responded with: 
"You don't need to know this for the exam" and went on to 
conclude the lecture. I was somewhat shocked by the answer. 
This episode has seriously undermined the authority of 
the teacher as a source of knowledge and enthusiasm for 
the subject. Was he assuming that I learn only for the exams
or unwilling to admit that he actually didn't know the
answers?

An inverse experience happened to me while tutoring for 
an undergraduate-level programming course. Instead of 
attempting to understand my explanations of some concepts 
and programming techniques, a student interrupted by asking 
something along the lines of: "Are we marked on this? 
Will this be part of the exam?"

##What could fix the situation after the fact? 
It is difficult to pinpoint the root cause of such behaviour. 
My guess is that the cause is systemic, as academics are
often assessed based on pass rates of their students, 
and students need good marks to progress and are
willing to give good feedback to lecturers who make
it easy to get good marks regardless of the learning 
outcomes. Often lecturers don't communicate well 
amongst each other so that students end up overloaded
with coursework which leads to them skipping everything
that doesn't contribute to the marks. 

Almost every other reaction would be better than
entirely ignoring my question (for instance staying for 
a few minutes after the lecture), whilst in general a complex 
trade-off between learning and marks-based assessment and 
workload needs to be made.
