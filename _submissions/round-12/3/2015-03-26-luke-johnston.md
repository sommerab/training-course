One graduate course I took looked interesting and fit with my
research.  The course was a mix of undergraduate and graduate
students.  The class had a one hour portion specific to the graduate
students and two hours of both grad and undergrad.  I really liked the
graduate portion.  The professor taught it well, it was much more
discussion based and was more applicable to research skills.  The
remaining class time on the other hand... was not so good.

In general the professor taught it well; however, there were many
times when there was *so much* complexity to the material, but the
professor did not slow down or make sure everyone was following along.
It was too much stuff, too quickly, and without taking it
step-by-step.  This was especially true of one of the quest lecturers!
He had a classic 'expert blind spot' going on, as he was clearly on
the top of his research expertise, but did not convey the material in
a way that was targetted to the students.  Not only that, but the
slides were... disorganized, non-uniform, and had content that was
never talked about or explicitly mentioned it was not needed.

*How it could have been fixed*: The best way to have fixed the problem
 was to any one or more of these things:

1. Slow down and explain the complexity step-by-step, trying to keep
   in mind the knowledge level of the students.
2. Use formative assessment tools to get a sense of students
   knowledge.
3. I could have asked more questions to clarify the complexity.
4. Speak to the professor afterwards.
5. The prof could have gotten the course content evaluated by other
   graduate students or colleagues.
6. Only include content that would actually be talked about, needed,
   or used.
7. Make the slides more organized, cleaner, clearer, and more
   consistent.
