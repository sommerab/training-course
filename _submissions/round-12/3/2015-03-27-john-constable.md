The grading on my university course was very variable, both in consistency and 
calrity of exptactations. One I particularly recall was a coding exercise in
RPG-III (we were THAT cutting edge!), where we had to construct a curses-like
interface on the mainframe (see earler comment regarding cutting edge).

The assignment was to validate user input and ensure consistency in the 
information input into the back end 'database'. One student (who also went on
to get a first class degree) went the addiitonal mile and addded help 'popups'
to all the input boxes, and was given 100%. Others who had fulfilled the brief
but not gone above got sligtly less (might even be 99%), and they were very upset
that a lecturer who was previously of the stated opinion that 'no one should get
 100%' was not only going against his word, but doing so in a way that had not
been indicated was possible (until someone had done it).

This would have been better addressed by a clear marking schedule, stating how 
the marking was scored and any opportunity for additional merit, even if that
was for unspecified 'out of the box' solutions.

Interesting to me how similar this is to greg's story, and how we probably all
have a similar version..

This didn't especially de-motivate me (as I was never an A student and hated
working in RPG-III anyway!), but I saw the effect on fellow students.
