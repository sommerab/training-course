During my studies of biochemistry I had a lecture series with more
than 100 other students. At the beginning of each class the professor
let a sheet circulating and everybody had to sign to prove his/her
presence. At some point of each lecture the professor took the list,
read the names and asked the called person to raise hands. This was a
very uncommon for us (in Germany). Usually we could freely choose
which lecture to attend and which to skip. Commonly it was our
responsibility to get the required information and pass the test in
the end. The lack of trust of this professor had a negative impact on
everybody and just lead to the fact that many unmotivated people had
to stay in the lecture. It even resulted in the running gag that each
time somebody added the name "Hand Maulwurf" (Hans Mole) to the list
and everybody was laughing when the professor was calling that name.

The improvement is rather simple. Such a list is not really helpful to
motivate young adults to attend a lecture. Simply stopping to use the
list would definitely reduced the amount of participants but increased
the percentage of people really motivated to listen to the lecture. I
have to admit that the number of participants would be rather low as
the lectures were a very bad.
