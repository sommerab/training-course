In general, nothing has really stuck out about one particular incident of
demotivation, but the entirety of my fourth year was pretty dire.
Part of it may have been a bit of mild burn out, and I should have taken some time to do something other than study, but for some reason, that year
I was completely uninterested in studying.
This was not a particular event, but spread over the entire year.
The courses were fine, and other people were doing well.

I think that the biggest issue was that I could not see any practical
application of my project.
Perhaps it was also that I never really bonded with the rest of the class either,
certainly not to the extent that they bonded with each other.

Thinking back on it, if I had had more freedom to follow up on things that I had
been interested in (essentially computational geoscience, rather than straight
geology), I think it would have gone a long way to keeping me interested.
Unfortunately, none of the staff were particularly interested in going that route,
so I was left to muddle through.
Coupled with not realising just how badly I was actually doing in the various
courses until far too late (communication from lecturers being poor), and I had
a pretty dismal year, academically.

Aside from that, it was mostly on me, and is not their fault.
Perhaps they could have intervened sooner, or suggested that I do something else?
