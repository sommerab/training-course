#### Introduction

This is a challenging post, and I have been thinking about this topic since
it was presented at the end of the most recent lesson conference call. While
it has been quite a few years since I last took classes as an undergraduate
or graduate student, I feel somewhat hard-pressed to come up with a good
example.

Obviously, _everybody_ has at some point encountered an instructor who could
have been yet more pursuasive, yet more prepared, yet more charismatic and,
last but certainly not least, more engaged and motivated. But while this is
true it is also somewhat obvious.  As students, I seem to recall that we were
always somewhat prepared for taking the below-average instructor together
will the above-average instructor. 

So sure, I could mention, say, a short required course on Statistical
Programming with SAS which I took during the MA year. Neither the students
nor the instructor were particularly motivated, and everybody just endured
the mandatory few instruction hours. But that is neither particularly
insightful nor novel.

That being said, we should always plan and strive for well-planned and
delivered instruction, which includes a level of motivation, engagement and
persuasiveness that wins the attention of the students

#### Note

I apologize for the late submission, but I attended the
[rOpenSci unconference](http://unconf.ropensci.org/) and subsequent travel
got in the way.
