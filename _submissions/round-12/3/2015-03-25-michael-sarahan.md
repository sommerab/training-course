The greatest demotivator I encountered in school was my second (of 3)
PhD advisor.  I was in a chemistry group, and we were studying
photocatalysis: how to make materials that used solar energy to split
water into hydrogen and oxygen.  The experiments for this research
involved 6-8 hour long sessions of getting up every half-hour, turning
a knob, pressing a button, and saving a file on a computer for the
measurement of hydrogen produced.  This was maddening to be chained to
the machine for so long.  I proposed an automation system, and was
told that if I could do so for under $5k, I could do it.  I got a
quote for all the necessary parts for ~3k.

Leading up to this, my advisor had also stated that I needed to put
more into my group presentations.  I worked really hard to polish this
particular one, which coincided with the other issue.

All of this culminated in a rather catastrophic group meeting wherein
he called my presentation sloppy, and said that we weren't going to
automate things because he had just been to visit the leaders in the
field, and none of them automated things.  I have never felt so
downtrodden and undervalued as I did that day.

He could have told me what he wanted in the presentation specifically,
rather than simply calling it "sloppy," and he certainly could have
shelled out $3k to make his research more reproducible and improve his
grad students' lives.  Otherwise, he could have at least had a better
reason, like "we can't afford this" - the excuse of "the leaders
aren't doing it, why should we?" was pretty lame.
