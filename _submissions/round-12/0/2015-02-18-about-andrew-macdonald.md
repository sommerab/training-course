Andrew MacDonald is a PhD student in [Diane Srivastava](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~srivast/people.html)'s lab at the University of British Columbia. His PhD research is all about the small, fascinating communities of animals that live in the water found in tropical bromeliads. As a result, he's done lots of field work in Brazi.

He was born in Nova Scotia, did his Master's with [Peter Kotanen](http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~w3pkota/) at the University of Toronto. He's also worked in Borneo with [Heath in Harmony](http://www.healthinharmony.org/) and Cam Webb on rainforest restoration. 

He's also come to really love programming and data analysis, particularly in R.

As a result of his background, Andrew would love to talk with you in any of his favourite languages: Portuguese, Indonesian and most of all, R.
