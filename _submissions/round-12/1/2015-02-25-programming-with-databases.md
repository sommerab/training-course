I've chosen to do a concept map on using databases inside general purpose programming languages. I've often seen code that attempts to do operations SQL does better inside for loops so I wanted to try to convey how to know when you might be doing things wrong. (Since I've just started with R, I feel there may be a similar relationship there with looping and lapply functions.)
