Here is my [practice video](https://vimeo.com/124884873) for functions in R.

I picked the very start of the functions lesson and worked through the temperature conversion functions.

I think I moved a little too fast and tried to fit too much in, other than that I'm happy with how it went.

The next step is nested functions and then asking students to make their own basic functions.
