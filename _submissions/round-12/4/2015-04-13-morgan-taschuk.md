I recorded a short video on using git diff to check modifications to files: [Software Carpentry Instructor training: git diff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTZDWyj6Iw)

It is from the Software Carpentry git novice lesson: http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/03-changes.html

I rushed a little at the end but otherwise I'm happy with it.
