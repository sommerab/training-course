Below is the link to my video. It is a short introduction to the Unix `grep` command. The content is from the SWC "Finding Things" lesson  [https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/06-find.html](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/06-find.html).

The Google account is under "Kc Caulfeild."

My teammates said it was clear (though I felt choppy and there are a lot of "um"s and pauses). They helpfully suggested I shrink the Google Hangout window openned in the background of my shell window. Looking at the video, I realise I should have started with a clean shell window without all the previous practise command runs visible on the screen.  I am using a PC and the Microsoft ScreenRecorder and only realised afterwards I could have chosen to capture just the shell window rather than the whole desktop.
