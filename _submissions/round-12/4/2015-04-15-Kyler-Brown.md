Video: [Intro to Mercurial](https://vimeo.com/125108504).

This video assumes the students are already familiar with the concepts of version control from Git. In retrospect,
that may not be the best assumption.

##Goals

  * Initializing a repository
  * Adding files
  * Committing
  * Checking the status and logs of the repository
