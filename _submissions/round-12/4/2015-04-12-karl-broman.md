Here is my [practice teaching video](https://vimeo.com/124722688), on
subsetting vectors in R.

I'm assuming that the students have already been introduced to the use
of `c()` to create a vector.

After these three minutes, I would continue by talking about using logical
vectors (e.g. `x[y > 10]`) and indexing with character strings using
the `names` attribute.
