A 3 minute video based on the [Creating
Functions](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/06-func.html)
part of the [Software Carpentry Python
materials](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/).

I had two partners who gave me feedback, [Adam
Richie-Holford](http://swcarpentry.github.io/training-course/2015/04/adam-richie-halford-video/)
and John Moreau. They both sounded very pleased with it overall. There
was a question that I may have used some jargon words here and
there. Adam pointed out in the previous round that and I tend to
stumble over words and I don't have a smooth speaking style.
Improving my speaking habits would help in many aspects of my life not
just teaching a workshop, but might prove extremely difficult to
achieve.

For some reason, the video capture did something strange with the
screen so some letters and text from the previous contents of the
terminal overlay the new contents.
