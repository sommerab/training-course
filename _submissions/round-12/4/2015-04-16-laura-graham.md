My video is based on the lesson [Creating functions in R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/02-func-R.html).

The main feedback I had from my partner was that I need to think more about how to explain the purpose of R functions. The way I described repeatability of code could equally be used to explain the motivations for using a for loop. In addition, she mentioned that the pace of the lesson was good and that I should use the auto-complete where possible.

My own feedback would be that I found this one more difficult due to the knowledge it was going to be recorded. I also think that I could have set up the R studio window better (it was set up to be optimal for how I work, rather than for demonstrating code).
