Here is my [video](https://youtu.be/MntP8g9thrk) for the practice lesson showing how to create a function in R. I chose the first part of the SWC [Creating Functions](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/02-func-R.html) in R lesson.

My teammate's feedback was very positive. I was told that my example was clear and that I was speaking at a good rate. I wish I would have elaborated on why one might want to make a custom function in R (or any language).
