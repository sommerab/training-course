I tried to contain the 3 minutes, but made accidentally 5 minutes [video](https://youtu.be/fa9vpoP9Rlo), which reflect [feedbacks](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-teaching-apac) from Belinda and Will.

-   Overall introduction about what I am going to teach; "set the scene"
-   Covering about the right amount of material, but in this video, it was not 3 minutes, maybe possible if Korean.
-   Use RStudio, instead of Vannila R IDE.

I installed three screen recording software. I decided to use Camtasia because it can save lots of time from recording to production. It's commercial, but it's worthwhile to consider purchasing. Thank you for introducing this software, Greg.
