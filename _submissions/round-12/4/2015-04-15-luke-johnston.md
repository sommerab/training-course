In my practice teaching session, I went through the basic usage of
[grep in the Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/06-find.html).
My video can be found at [this link](https://youtu.be/VTYi551V15g).

My teammate's comment was that I did a good job discussing grep and
talking in more detail on different options in grep and their usage.
I felt I was stuttering a bit too much and/or drifted off, which is
something that I always have to deal with.
