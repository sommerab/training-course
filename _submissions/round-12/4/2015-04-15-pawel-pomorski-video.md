In the video I teach the grep command.  The material comes from the beginning of the lesson [Finding Things](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/06-find.html), 
section 7 of the Unix Shell tutorial.  I selected this topic because it is self-contained and can be presented coherently in 3 minutes.

[The video is posted on YouTube](https://youtu.be/lK-nsVDkqys).

Watching the video afterwards I realised with some dismay that I am repeatedly making the mistake of saying I am searching for one thing, 
while my shell command actually shows me searching for something else.  I can only hope this was caused by my nervousness when making this video,
and that I don't make that kind of switch habitually when I teach. 

I used Camtasia for the recording (the free trial version) and it worked very well.  Editing the video afterwards was a breeze, 
and I could easily remove the awkward pauses at the beginning and the end.  That's why the video is slightly shorter than 3 minutes.
