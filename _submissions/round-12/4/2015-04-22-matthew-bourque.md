Here is my practice teaching video.  I chose the topic of selecting data from a SQL database.

I assume that the student knows how to create a sqlite database and connect to it using sqlite3 (i.e. has completed the "Setting Up" section of the lesson).  I discuss how to perform a simple query, and dabble into how to make the query more complex to retreive only a particular subset of the database.

After watching myself, I think I did a decent job covering the material, though I could use to be a bit louder and a bit more enthusiastic!
