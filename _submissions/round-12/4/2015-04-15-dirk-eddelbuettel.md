#### Introduction

This short posts contains
[the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RQWyOdCDks&feature=youtu.be)
from the online teaching session with Violet Zhang and myself on April 13.  I
chose a topic related to R package building and particularly unit testing
given the simplest R mechanism: the `tests/` directory a package can contain.

#### Feedback

Violet was once again very polite yet concise.  Some of the material may be a
little too advanced. I also stumbled over some things not prepared yet ---
but that comes with the territory of live coding in a lesson.
