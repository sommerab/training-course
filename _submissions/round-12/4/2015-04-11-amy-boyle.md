I chose to teach [debugging in python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/06-func.html). It picks up after teaching functions, and I start with a function already defined. I went over, and my video is almost 5 mintues long. I would have prefered, even, to take another minute to two to teach this section. So next time I know to take a smaller bite of material.

The video is on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hjo_ceurjfA&feature=youtu.be). Sorry the audio quailty is not great.
