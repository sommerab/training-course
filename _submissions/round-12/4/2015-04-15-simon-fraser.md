For my three minute test presentation I covered the start of [python lists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Sp_QwOnzA&feature=youtu.be)
from [the python material](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/03-lists.html)

There is also a sound-free version thanks to my own [recording efforts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKcVWawDrPM&feature=youtu.be)

I perhaps should have covered the syntax of creating a list more clearly, as
the square-bracket and comma syntax may be confusing to new starters. I tried
to build on previous material as slices and indexing are mentioned in relation
to strings earlier in the course.
