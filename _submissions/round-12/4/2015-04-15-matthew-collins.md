I chose to teach creating a directory and a file in the shell from this lesson:

[The Unix Shell, Creating Things](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-create.html)

Unfortunately the recording is terrible. The audio is very low due to my other teacher's background 
noise and the video capture didn't pick up the right window. I recommend watching someone else's 
video as I think I'm the only one who can figure out what is going on :)
