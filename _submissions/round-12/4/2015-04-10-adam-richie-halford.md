[Here is video](https://youtu.be/I8cc6R3sW5g) of my practice lesson for
loops in the Unix shell. I chose the very first part of the [SWC shell
loops lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/04-loop.html).
The lesson ends abruptly at about three minutes because I ran out of
time. Any extra time would have gone to more examples.

My teammates' feedback was mostly positive. On the positive side, they
said that I spoke clearly and that the lesson had a good logical flow.
On the negative side, it seemed a bit too fast. They recommended that I
work on slowing down the pace a bit to be more accomodating to novice
learners.
