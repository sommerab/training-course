Here is the link to my short lesson on Creating Things in the Unix Shell. I chose this topic because working with the Shell was completely foreign to me before I took a Software Carpentry Bootcamp and I wanted to learn the material better myself. I covered some material from this SWC lesson: [http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-create.html](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-create.html).

My teammate said I was pretty clear and did a good job of explaining things. However, he did say I went at a faster pace than our last online lesson (I agree).
