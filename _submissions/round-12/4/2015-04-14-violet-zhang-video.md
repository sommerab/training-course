I am trying to teach how to create things in the unix shell, but went a little overtime.

Here is my [teaching video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5eups1dNjI)

I need to prepare better for the time management. I originally plan to teach how to rename, cp and delete things, but couldn't finish within the 3 min time. Also, I was quite nevous and pronounced things wrong in the video.
