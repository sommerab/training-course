Here is my [practice teaching video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-4C1IfnirU) for programming in R.

I chose the first section of [Creating functions](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/02-func-R.html) in the Programming in R lessons.  
The feedback from the other members in my group was positive. I had the functions written out beforehand  R Studio so the lesson would proceed more smoothly.  One teammate suggested that I try running through the lesson by typing out the functions in full during the lesson but that would have taken more than three minutes.
