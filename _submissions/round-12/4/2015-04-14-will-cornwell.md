Here is [a video on writing simple for loops in R](http://youtu.be/UtUUqN9FUIg).  It's pretty basic, but it could fit well into a number of different larger lesson like one on processing multiple files.  

I have heard from Victor that I should work more on putting informative comments in my code as I go, 
which is a very good suggestion, but hard to implement in short videos.
