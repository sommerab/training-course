My three minute practice teaching video on Filtering in SQL taken from the [Database and SQL Lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/03-filter.html). I used IShowU to record it but somehow managed to set the recording so it clipped the left hand character from the video.

[The video is posted on YouTube](https://youtu.be/p0rPP3V6xbk).

As discussed in the last group call, I used a couple of 'invisible keystrokes' and based on feedback from others in my group I should have been clearer about how I was achieving some of the results (e.g. use of up arrow to get previous command, use of 'ctrl+L' on Mac to clear the screen).
