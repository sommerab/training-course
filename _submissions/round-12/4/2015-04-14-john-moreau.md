For my lesson, I recorded a brief video on 
[reading data into R](https://youtu.be/e_jKUQNtWjA). 

I based my lesson on [the current R lessons using inflammation data](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/01-starting-with-data.html). 

One thing I didn't expect was that it would take three minutes just to get from setting my working directory to reading the data. Now I feel like I have a better understanding of why beginner workshops don't go further with the material.
