My three minute practice teaching video on Python conditionals from the novice Python lesson on [Conditionals](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/05-cond.html).

It is definitely harder than I expected to code live and talk (teach) at the same time. Even though it is outside my comfort zone I found this an excellent way to practice.

I stumbled a bit and made some mistakes, but my teammates provided useful constructive criticism delivered in a very kind way.

I used SimpleScreenRecorder to record the video during our Hangouts session. The result is now available on Vimeo [here](https://vimeo.com/124911427), and embedded below:
