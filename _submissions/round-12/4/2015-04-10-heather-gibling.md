Here is my [practice teaching video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwHynNv1hY0) for programming in R.

I chose the bit on subsetting character vectors from the first R lesson ([Analyzing Patient Data](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/01-starting-with-data.html)), as my first practice teaching was on subsetting data tables.

Feedback from my teammates was positive. They mentioned that it flowed nicely and that there weren't many 'uhhs' and 'umms' (though I hear so many!), and suggested that I add a bit of an explanation of why I would want to do something (like reverse the subset, or remove an instance) instead of just doing it.
