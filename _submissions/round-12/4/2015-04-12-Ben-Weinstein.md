My video: [R help files](https://youtu.be/vy8htcaVDLI)

The video assumes students have used R functions, but not thought about the organization in a detailed way.

##Goals

  * How to access a help page in R
  * What are the inputs?
  * What are the defaults?
  * Where can i find examples?
  
After this i'd have students answer some questions that they would answer by looking into new help functions, and then have students introduce each other to new functions.

I'm slightly over, at ~ 3:40 seconds, but i welcome feedback on the whole thing.
