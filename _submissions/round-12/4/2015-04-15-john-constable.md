For my three minute demo, I covered creating things in the unix shell as per:
http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-create.html

I stopped when i hit 3 mins rather than make a full coverage of the topic!

This time I had no video, as I was just recording the terminal session and it 
was striking how much I missed the feedback.
I found it hard to turn off the screen capture util (quicktime), so more 
practice next time for a more policed permormance!
Its really hard to know beforehand how all the tools will interact, I found, 
so hoping this will improve as we practice!
I have been choosing tpics that I know, rather than ones that are completely 
foriegn, so perhaps next time choosing one thats not
so familar would be a good idea to better simulate the overall experience!
    
I found this https://sysadmincasts.com an excellent primer for watching others do similar, but as I expected much harder to make it look seamless - I wonder how many repeats they had to do! 
    
I find it very hard to rewatch myself!
