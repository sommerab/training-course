I taught how to use the *git log* and *git diff* commands from the [Version Control with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice) lesson. I tried to explain the usefulness of the two commands for keeping track of what has been done, and when they  would be used. 

My video is on YouTube at [http://youtu.be/EX_W8DOt-1o](http://youtu.be/EX_W8DOt-1o). Unfortunately, some of the screen real estate has been 'eaten' by the ad for the screencast software, but I hope it is still intelligible. 

One feedback comment I got was "Good explanation of git diff - very clear and well-paced, with demo."
