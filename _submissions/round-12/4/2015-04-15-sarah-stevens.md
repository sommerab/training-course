Here is my teaching practice video, a small section of the lesson on [tracking changes in git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/03-changes.html).

I was a bit nervous at the beginning, likely because I am recording myself to post on the internet.
My nerves caused me to trip up a bit on what I was saying at the beginning and I accidently used tab-complete.
I'll add my feedback for myself as a comment tomorrow.  I appreciate any additional feedback you can give me!  Thanks!
