I recorded myself teaching a very basic introduction to Functions in Python, in less than three minutes.
The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XozGjngpwUo) is on my YouTube channel that I just set up for the occasion.

I used QuickTime (pre-installed on Mac) and the iPython notebook that came with Anaconda.
Setting-up the recording, actual recording, seting up the YouTube channel, uploading, and writing this blog entry took 60 minutes.
