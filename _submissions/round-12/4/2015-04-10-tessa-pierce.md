I chose to teach about pipes in Unix, taken directly from the [novice shell lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-pipefilter.html). 

Video [on youtube](https://youtu.be/e_NsO6u2tgM). Some feedback I'll mention (to avoid it being repeated) was 1. bigger font, and 2. fewer distractions (let terminal take up the entire screen). Other feedback would be much appreciated!

A note of caution to mac users who haven't recorded yet - be sure to select a microphone before doing a screen capture with Quicktime -- otherwise you won't record audio! I ended up re-recording right after our group's google hangout (too bad I forgot to fix the font size issue, eh?). This could have also been avoided by actually reading Greg's instructions, rather than presuming I remembered how to screencap ;).
