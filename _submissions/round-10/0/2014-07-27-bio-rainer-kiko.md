I am a postdoctoral fellow at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, Germany. I work on zooplankton ecophysiology and particle dynamics in the tropical Atlantic and Pacific. I am mainly using Python for oceanographic data processing with Postgres SQL and Matplotlib. I have started picking up scientific computing at the end of 2011 and this made a huge difference in my ability to handle data. I hope to motivate my students and colleagues to also use tools like the Shell, Python and SQL.
