I found this tricky for two main reasons. 1) I don't I know how to do most of these things in an advanced way, definitely trying to figure that out! and 2) While I think better computational knowledge is useful for everything, I don't usually think of it in terms of task based goals. So I think the things I wrote will develop as I think about it more! But presenting direct applications will definitely help learners apply skills.

1.  How do I store my data? 
    *   Novice: Series of excel spreadsheets
    *   Intermediate: SQL or other relational database, Flat files accessed by scripts
    *   Advanced: I'm not sure! RDF? Web2.0? Hadoop?
2.  How do I navigate the command line? 
    *   Novice: Be able to run software written by others
    *   Intermediate: Some regular expressions, and writing simple bash scripts or Python programs. Installing necessary libraries, and parsing and dealing with error messages.
    *   Advanced: Same, but better!
3.  How can I automate the mundane parts of my work such as formatting input files or pulling out the useful parts out of verbose output? 
    *   Novice: Do lots of it by hand, write some scripts for issues that occur repeatedly
    *   Intermediate: Have dedicated code for these processes, run some error checks
    *   Advanced: Well written scripts, thorough error checking.
4.  How can I understand the legacy code that has been handed down in my lab? 
    *   Novice: Don't! Just run it and hope it works.
    *   Intermediate: Read through it --- add some comments to clarify.
    *   Advanced: Re-write to make it clearer and more efficient
5.  How can I write code that my collaborators and labmates can understand? 
    *   Novice: Lots of comments
    *   Intermediate: Clear well written code with comments for confusing parts
    *   Advanced: Logical object oriented programming with comments where helpful
6.  How can I make a computational pipeline that I can trust? 
    *   Novice: Cobble steps together and hope it works.
    *   Intermediate: Write a script to tie together the process. Run error checking.
    *   Advanced: Test boundary cases. Speed up steps that are slowing it down
