Everyone has added a lot of great ideas! Like Ben I took a different tack and I tried to think of some of the common complaints I remember hearing in grad school:

1. My program is crashing!

*   Novice: changes things at random, adds print statements
*   Intermediate: knows how to read a Python traceback, understands common error cases
*   Advanced: uses a debugger, logs program state, uses assertions to enforce program validity

2. My results are wrong and I don't know why!

*   Novice: changes things at random, adds print statements, spends a lot of time reading source code
*   Intermediate: keeps intermediate results
*   Advanced: writes code in small, functional units and uses unit tests to ensure correctness

3. I don't know if my results are right!

*   Novice: eyeballs things or assumes correctness
*   Intermediate: manually compares results to previous runs or other codes
*   Advanced: writes code in small, functional units and uses unit tests to ensure correctness. uses regression tests to compare to known results.

4. I want my computer to do X, but I don't know how!

*   Novice: guesses, googles, uses naive solutions
*   Intermediate: checks online knowledge bases like stackoverflow or looks in books
*   Advanced: asks colleagues/computing specialists

5. I want to use package X, but I can't get it installed!

*   Novice: try for a few hours, give up.
*   Intermediate: read the instructions, try for a few minutes, give up.
*   Advanced: re-write the install script and compile core libraries for days until it works.
