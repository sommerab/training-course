Hmm, only five right now. I'll add a few others as they come to me.

**How can I write code more like a software developer and less like a scientist playing on a computer?**

1.  Novice: Write better code: no two letter variables, useful comments.
2.  Intermediate: Organize code better: functions, classes.
3.  Advanced: Make reusable code, organize into pipelines.

**How do I improve my efficiency?**

1.  Novice: Make code more readable, lower amount of re-learning needed with each revisit.
2.  Intermediate: Create libraries of reusable code.
3.  Advanced: Version control my work.

**How do I know that my results are "correct"?**

1.  Novice: Check entire code against known situations.
2.  Intermediate: Test individual functions as I write them.
3.  Advanced: Use test suites and testing frameworks to test continuously.

**How do I identify and fix the bugs in my code?  
**

1.  Novice: Print statements
2.  Intermediate: De-buggers and test suites.
3.  Advanced: Automated, continuous test suites.

**How can I make my work more trustworthy?*

1.  Novice: Provide code upon request.
2.  Intermediate: Provide version controlled code, data, upon request.
3.  Advanced: Keep code, results, public. Publish location along with papers.
