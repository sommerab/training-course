I chose ControlFlow (because I've already drawn the diagram for it...).

iPython Notebook :[gist][1] , [nbviewer][2]

Teaching Questions :

How you would use the notebook in front of a class when teaching live?

*   I would let the students download the whole notebook, fully coded, but would have them see the differences that they could create in behavior by changing variables. Exercises in the notebook would start out blank, but would be filled out by students dynamically during class.

How wouldlearners go through it on their own outside of class?

*   Learners would do the same outside of class, reading the text and changing variables experimentally, then trying out the exercises on their own.

How does your use of the IPython Notebook relate to one or more of the things you encountered in Mark’s blog or Bret Victor’s demo and essay?

*   I think that everything about experimentation in the notebook and writing up dynamic, responsive exercise responses in the notebook has this quality of "**People understand what they can see.**" I would add, of course, that people only truly see what they TRY.
