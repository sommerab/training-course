The topic I want to teach is how variables and variable assignment work in Python. In particular, I want to try to get across the subtle differences that occur between mutable and immutable types that can catch newbies off guard.

This is still a work in progress. Among other things I want to try to code up some sort of live visualization of what each variable is pointing to as I update them---I think can be done even in IPython Notebook. I'll try to update this once the material is updated:
