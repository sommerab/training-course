Ian Mitchell is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. He has a broad background --- holding degrees in engineering physics, computer science and computational mathematics --- and is interested in better ways of using algorithmic thinking in all fields of science and engineering. Ian typically teaches courses in numerical methods, although he has designed and taught a CS1 course for students in the life sciences and a graduate course (with Dhavide Aruliah) on reproducible research. He usually programs in Matlab, but Python is a fun alternative. His research focuses on the use of numerical algorithms in formal verification, optimal control, robotics and dynamic implicit surfaces.
