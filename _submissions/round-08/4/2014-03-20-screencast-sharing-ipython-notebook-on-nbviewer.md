A few experice dooing this screencast:

1.   Get a english localized computer people don't read french in the menu.
2.  3 minutes is both too short and too long.
3.   Even if you think you will be alone in your office for at least 10 min that not true. 
    *   corollary: At least 6 major interruption happened in you office every hours, which make around 50/day.
    *   Remark: My headset isolate me from probably 4 out of 5.
    *   Conclusion; Steel Need to find a quieter place to write dissertation.
4.  Don't try to do a screencast when you are sick and almost  can't speak, even if 3 min seem short enough not to cough. You will eventually rip your lung out of your chest a few time before giving up. You'll achieve barely something maybe a few hours before the SWC meeting.
5.  I'm more confortable discussing in english and having immediate feedback than speaking to nothing. Screencast are hard because you expect everything to be with perfect timing and no hesitation.

I'll try to update that when my voice get better and add a more permanent link later.
